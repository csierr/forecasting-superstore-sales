# 📈 Forecasting Superstore Sales

This project explores **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Time Series Forecastin**g on a retail dataset from Kaggle, featuring four years of global superstore sales data.

The main objective is to analyze historical sales trends and build forecasting models to predict future sales, comparing different approaches in terms of accuracy and interpretability.

# 🔍 Project Goals

- Explore and visualize key trends and patterns in the sales data (EDA)
  
- Prepare the dataset for time series modeling
  
- Apply and compare several time series forecasting models

- valuate model performance using metrics such as MAPE, MAE, and R²

- Visualize model predictions and reflect on model strengths, limitations, and potential improvements

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn, statsmodels
- Theta, ARIMA and Prophet forecasting models
- Jupyter Notebooks

# 🚧 Status

This project represents a complete first attempt at tackling time series forecasting using real-world retail data. It includes end-to-end steps from data exploration to model evaluation and comparison.

While the core goals have been met, there’s room for future improvements, such as:

* Fine-tuning model parameters

* Trying other models or ensemble forecasting techniques

* Automating model selection and evaluation

As a first structured forecasting project, it's a solid foundation — and a great stepping stone for more advanced forecasting work to come.
